        <p>Meeting the challenges of our government's net-zero carbon targets is now influencing the decisions
            we take in daily life.</p>
        <p>I am writing to introduce MyBalance which is an app-based programme designed to work for social 
            landlords and your customers to help us all tackle climate change pressures, it works by helping 
            customers make lifestyle changes and can lead to a zero-carbon footprint.</p>
        <p>MyBalance is different in that it focuses on people and the way we live, rather than the energy 
            (EPC) rating of the home we live in. It can be offered to all customers simultaneously, irrespective of 
            their home energy rating.</p>
        <p>We recognise that altering lifelong behaviours can be challenging, however, MyBalance provides 
            tailored support to help make these important lifestyle changes easier.</p>
        <p>Designed by experienced housing specialists who know the sector, MyBalance will work with and  
            support your carbon reduction strategies.</p>
        <p>The nature of MyBalance allows the app to be branded as your product should you wish to use it 
            that way, it also offers direct one-way messaging with your customers through the app platform for 
            your newsfeed  and to share climate change issues.</p>
        <p>I have attached a short presentation that may be of interest to you, and our 
            website can be found at <a href="https://mybalance.earth">mybalance.earth</a>, if you wish to discuss how MyBalance can 
            support your business, please contact us. Our details are set out below.</p>
