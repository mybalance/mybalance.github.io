                        <p>Balance has been designed to help individuals take control of, and make decisions about, the harmful greenhouse gases generated as we live our busy lives</p>
                        <p>Our easy to access app allows you to quickly establish your historical footprint. After which, we have a help menu and carbon saving tips that will support you in making the right changes</p>
                        <p>Balance regularly updates you about the impact of climate change. Should you want to reduce your carbon impact, Balance has bespoke carbon offsetting schemes. These enable you to take positive and direct action to do something about the carbon you cannot remove from from your busy lifestyle</p>
                        <p>Using the Balance dynamic calculator your phone can collect data as you go about your daily life, monitoring things such as the emissions produced by your personal car over a specific journey. You can input into Balance on a daily, weekly or monthly basis, recording your actions and building an accurate picture of how you are doing compared to your self assessment targets</p>
                        <p>We know that the average person in the UK generates over 10 tonnes of harmful carbon dioxide per year - about 4 times what the planet can sustain. Our Government has pledged to cut emissions to 4 tonnes per capita by 2050, without individual action this is going to be very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Atmospheric carbon levels are at an all time high, and barely a week goes by without another major issue being attributed to climate change. If you care about our planet, and believe it should be here for future generations to enjoy, you likely need to make some changes in your lifestyle, starting today</p>
